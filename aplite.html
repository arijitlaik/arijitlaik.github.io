Description
This film shows an aplite. This is a rock a rock hipoabisal acid. These rocks are the result of the recent crystallization of fluids in the evolution of a magmatic body and the crystallized surface areas of the cortex have a fine grain size. This rock is composed mainly of crystals of fine grain size of alkali feldspar, plagioclase, quartz with some muscovite and tourmaline crystals.

Genetic implications
The aplites are rocks that are generated by the crystallization of residual fluid from the crystallization of an igneous pluton. These melts are characteristically rich in volatiles and incompatible elements. Aplites normally present compositional characteristics of the granites and consist of quartz, feldspar, plagioclase and muscovite. May be other minerals associated with these rocks like tourmaline or beryl. One of the most striking textural characteristics of the aplites is the fine grain size occur as a result of rapid cooling of molten aplite.
