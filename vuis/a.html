Indeed, extensional deformation and strike-slip faulting are observed over an enormous area covering some 30 million square kilometres, from Indonesia to Kamchatka. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">This deformation took place across the entire region during the Eocene–Oligocene. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">In several locations, extension was also active in the latest Cretaceous/Paleocene (e.g. Beibuwan basin, Pearl River Mouth basin, Taiwan Strait basins, East China Sea basins, Yellow Sea basins, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Bohai basin, Heilongjiang basin), thus preceding collision, and/or during part of the Miocene–Present (e.g. Mergui basin, Banda Sea, southern South China Sea, Okinawa Trough, Japan Sea and margins, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Kuril Basin).<br><br></span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Previous geodynamic models simulating Asian deformation used an active rigid indenter to simulate India progressively moving into and colliding with the Asian lithosphere, thereby applying compressive deviatoric normal stresses. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Another model focused on gravitational spreading of the East Asian lithosphere and did not include an active Indian indenter. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">All these earlier models used passive lateral boundaries in East and Southeast Asia with zero stress or lithostatic stress boundaries, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">simulating passive subduction zone rollback (i.e. subduction zone migration that resulted only from the Indian indenter and/or gravitational spreading and not from forces originating from the subduction zone itself). </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">However, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">geodynamic models show that subduction zones actively deform overriding plates during slab rollback by applying deviatoric stresses </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">at the subduction zone interface and flow-induced shear tractions at the base of the overriding plate.</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Recent studies have investigated the formation of the Himalaya and the Tibetan Plateau through modelling subduction and continental subduction. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Such models involved a relatively limited spatial domain of Asian continental lithosphere and excluded the Western Pacific subduction margin and most of the Sunda subduction margin. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Our current study focusses on a much larger domain of Asian continental lithosphere (about an order of magnitude larger), stretching from the Himalaya and Tibet in the west, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Indonesia in the southeast and Kamchatka in the northeast (Fig.&nbsp;</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">1). </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Here we investigate the role of the Western Pacific subduction margin and the entire Sunda subduction </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">margin in Asian deformation and their interaction with Indian indenter tectonics and large-scale mantle flow.</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Our models reveal that the synchronous activity and interaction of the collision zone and subduction zones are crucial for explaining the entire deformation field in Central, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">East and Southeast Asia and demonstrate that enigmatic east–west extension in Tibet, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">eastward continental extrusion and backarc basin formation along the East and Southeast Asian margins are controlled by large-scale Pacific and Sunda slab rollback. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">The experiments constrain the amount of Indian indentation, thereby predicting the amount of eastward continental extrusion. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Our quantification of Indian indentation and Western Pacific rollback also makes predictions on the large-scale mantle flow in the region and implies large-scale clockwise upper mantle </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">circulation from the Tibetan region towards East Asia and from the Philippine Sea region along a path south of the Sunda–Banda slab wall into the Indian Ocean domain.</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">As such, our experiments demonstrate the crucial role that the Western Pacific and Sunda subduction zones have played in actively deforming the continental lithosphere and underlying mantle in Central, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">East and Southeast Asia.<br><br></span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Results.<br><br>Experimental approach.<br><br></span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Here we present the first geodynamic models of widespread continental deformation in Central, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">East and Southeast Asia combining two separate approaches that simultaneously simulate active Indian indentation and active rollback of the Western Pacific and Sunda subduction zones (Fig.&nbsp;</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">2). The active rollback boundaries apply deviatoric tensile stress conditions (trench suction) and slab rollback-induced basal mantle flow tractions to the overriding continental Eurasian lithosphere. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">The analogue experiments use glass microspheres with a frictional plastic rheology to simulate the brittle upper </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">continental lithosphere and high-viscosity silicone to simulate the viscous continental lower lithosphere of Eurasia.</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Low-viscosity glucose syrup is used to simulate the low-viscosity sub-lithospheric mantle for isostatic compensation and mantle flow. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">The models are scaled for gravity, including gravitational body forces and potential energy differences between the continental and oceanic domains. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Furthermore, we implement length scaling and geometrical aspect ratios such that, for the first time, the model components accurately represent the size of the Indian indenter (~2400&thinsp;km), </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">the western Pacific subduction margin (~8000&thinsp;km), </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">the Sunda subduction zone (~4000&thinsp;km) and the Asian lithospheric thickness (~104&thinsp;km) at the onset of collision (see “Methods”).<br><br></span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Fig. 2.<br><br></span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Schematic diagrams illustrating the experimental apparatus set-up. The experiments investigate widespread deformation of a layered brittle–ductile system simulating part of the Eurasian continental lithosphere. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">a Top view of the experimental apparatus. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Deformation in the model lithosphere is induced by northward motion of a rigid boundary (simulating progressive indentation of India into Eurasia and roll forward of the Indian </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">slab and hinge) and outward motion of two retreating boundaries (simulating eastward slab rollback of the Western Pacific subduction margin and southward rollback of the Sunda slab).</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Motion of the three boundaries is driven by three step-motors. b, c East–west cross-sectional views

style="cursor: pointer;">and a bottom layer made of low-viscosity glucose syrup with a linear viscous rheology (dynamic shear viscosity of 254&thinsp;±&thinsp;7&thinsp;Pa&thinsp;s) to simulate the sub-lithospheric mantle. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Note that only the inner compartment of the box is filled with the layered system (continental lithosphere), </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">while the entire box is filled with the low-viscosity bottom layer (sub-lithospheric upper mantle) to isostatically support the model continental lithosphere. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Also note that 1&thinsp;cm in the model represents 80&thinsp;km in nature.<br><br></span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Full size image.<br><br></span><span style="cursor: pointer;">We test the role of the advance rate (indentation rate) of the India–Eurasia convergent boundary, i.e. the Indian continental subduction zone hinge and slab (vI), </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">relative to the rollback rate of the Western Pacific (vWP) and Sunda (vSu) subduction zones on the style and extent of continental deformation in Asia. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">In three experiments, we test different rates for vI (keeping vWP and vSu constant). </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">We test minimum and intermediate rates of 2.0&thinsp;cm&thinsp;year (experiment IMIN-R) and 3.6&thinsp;cm&thinsp;year </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">(experiment IINT-R) based on minimum and maximum Asian shortening estimates of ~1000 and 1800–2000&thinsp;km,</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">respectively, averaged over the past ~52&thinsp;Myr. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">And we test a maximum rate of 5.2&thinsp;cm&thinsp;year (experiment IMAX-R) assuming that the </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">India–Eurasia convergence rate averaged over ~52&thinsp;Myr is accommodated entirely by shortening in Eurasia (“Methods”).</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">In two additional experiments, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">we test Indian indentation without Pacific–Sunda rollback (vWP&thinsp;=&thinsp;vSu&thinsp;=&thinsp;0) (experiment IINT-NR) and Pacific–Sunda rollback without Indian indentation (vI&thinsp;=&thinsp;0) (experiment NI-R). </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Below we show that the style and distribution of Asian deformation depends critically on the relative velocities of vI and vWP, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">expressed as ratio R&thinsp;=&thinsp;(vI&thinsp;−&thinsp;vWP)/(vI&thinsp;+&thinsp;vWP), and on the amount of Indian indentation (II).<br><br></span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Experimental results of Asian deformation.<br><br></span><span style="cursor: pointer;">The experiments all show the development of a fold-and-thrust belt north of the Indian indenter, comparable to nature and earlier models, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">which becomes increasingly asymmetric with decreasing R (Figs.&nbsp;</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">3–5, Supplementary Figs.&nbsp;1–4). </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">By increasing Indian finite indentation from IMIN-R to IINT-R to IMAX-R, extension in East Asia is progressively suppressed, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">in particular in the central East Asian region located west of the Japan, Ryukyu and Manila subduction zones, but strike-slip faulting and eastward extrusion are enhanced (Figs.&nbsp;</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">3a–c, 4a–c, 6a, b). </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Strike-slip faulting is mostly confined to the regions east and west of the indenter and </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">to a zone extending from the northeast corner of the indenter to the Kuril–Kamchatka region,</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">which accommodates sinistral shear. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">The deformed grid and displacement field show eastward and southeastward extrusion of continental material but only with active Pacific and Sunda rollback (Figs.&nbsp;3, 5 and 6b, Supplementary Fig.&nbsp;3). </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">The infinitesimal displacement fields for the last stage of the experiments (Fig.&nbsp;</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">5a–c), which represent the present-day displacement field, are generally consistent with and comparable to the Global Positioning System (GPS) velocity field observed in Central and East Asia. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Indeed, both experimental and observational fields show approximately radially divergent vectors north of the Indian indenter that decrease in length with increasing distance from the indenter, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">east-directed vectors in central and northern East Asia and a clockwise rotating vector pattern near the northeast corner of the indenter and in Southeast Asia. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">For models IMIN-R and IINT-R, the east-directed vectors in central and northern East Asia increase in length towards the east (Fig.&nbsp;</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">5a, b) but they decrease for model IMAX-R (Fig.&nbsp;5c).<br><br></span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Fig. 3.<br><br></span><span style="cursor:

image.<br><br></span><span style="cursor: pointer;">With low II&thinsp;=&thinsp;~1049&thinsp;km and R&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.25, strike-slip faulting is limited but extensional deformation in East and Southeast Asia is penetrative, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">with normal faulting and rifting distributed over a wide area (Figs.&nbsp;</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">3a and 4a). </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">With intermediate indentation (II&thinsp;=&thinsp;~1888&thinsp;km) and R&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.50, normal faults, rifts and grabens are still widely distributed but smaller in number and size, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">while strike-slip faults are more pronounced (Figs.&nbsp;</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">3b and 4b), a number of which form conjugate pairs. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Interestingly, model IINT-R&nbsp;shows an asymmetry of strike-slip faulting east and west of the Indian indenter with significant strike-slip faulting along its eastern boundary, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">dominated by dextral north–south to NNE–SSW striking faults and lesser conjugate ENE–WSW striking sinistral faults but limited strike-slip faulting along its western boundary (Fig.&nbsp;</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">4b). </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">This is in agreement with the first-order strike-slip faulting patterns observed east and west of the Indian indenter, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">showing limited strike-slip faulting west of India and significant strike-slip faulting east of India </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">with north–south striking dextral faults (e.g. Sagin fault) and lesser conjugate ENE–WSW striking sinistral faults (Fig.</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">1a).<br><br></span><span style="cursor: pointer;">The widespread extensional structures as observed in IMIN-R and IINT-R are absent in earlier experimental models that lack active Pacific and Sunda rollback. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">The extensional structures in IMIN-R and IINT-R occur up to ~5000&thinsp;km (for II&thinsp;=&thinsp;~</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">1049&thinsp;km) and ~4000&thinsp;km (for II&thinsp;=&thinsp;~1888&thinsp;km) from the Pacific subduction boundary (Fig.</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">4a, b), comparable in distance to the far-field extension in the Baikal rift zone.<br><br></span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Along the Pacific subduction boundary, the nearest rift and graben structures form some 400–600&thinsp;km west of this boundary (Fig.&nbsp;</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">4a, b), which is comparable to the distance between the Pacific trench and the Okinawa, Japan, Okhotsk and Kuril backarc basins. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">The extensional structures mostly run sub-parallel to the Pacific and Sunda subduction boundaries, both in the experiments (Fig.&nbsp;4a, b) and in nature (Fig.&nbsp;1a). </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">However, they also strike obliquely to perpendicularly to the boundaries in some regions (both in the experiments and in nature), such as in the northeastern region (Sea of Okhotsk), </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">which results from the asymmetric rotational rollback of the Pacific slab, and in the southeast, which results from the interference pattern of deformation produced by the two retreating subduction zones, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">in combination with asymmetric rollback. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">The occurrence of obliquely oriented extensional structures, postulated oblique backarc spreading ridges, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">and their spatial association with strike-slip faults in the Japan–Kuril–Okhotsk domain has been used as an argument against slab rollback as their driving agent. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">The current model results and an earlier regional study indicate that such obliquely oriented extensional structures and strike-slip </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">faults can in fact result directly from subduction zone processes along the Sunda and Western Pacific plate boundaries.</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">In case of a high II&thinsp;=&thinsp;~2728&thinsp;km and R&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.62 (experiment IMAX-R), folds, thrusts and strike-slip faults, the latter often in conjugate pairs, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">are very pronounced, while normal faulting is limited to the southeast and northeast (Figs.&nbsp;</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">3c and 4c). </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Notably, normal faulting and rifting are absent in central East Asia (west of Japan, Ryukyu and Manila), </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">resulting in a ~3000&thinsp;×&thinsp;3000&thinsp;km area that lacks east–west extension but instead shows east–west </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">shortening with approximately north–south striking zones of dextral transpression in the western part of the area (Fig.</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">4c). Also, no extensional structures form along the Western Pacific subduction boundary, in disagreement with observations of Cenozoic backarc extension along the Pacific margin and extension in East China (Fig.&nbsp;</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">1a). In addition, model IMAX-R shows a symmetrical pattern of strike-slip faulting east and west of India (Fig.&nbsp;</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">4c), which is not in agreement with nature with significant strike-slip faulting along the eastern boundary but limited strike-slip faulting along the western boundary (Fig.&nbsp;1a).<br><br></span><span style="cursor: pointer;">In the experiment that lacks Western Pacific and Sunda rollback (IINT-NR, R&thinsp;=&thinsp;1), eastward extrusion is negligible (Figs.&nbsp;3d, 5d and 6b, Supplementary Fig.&nbsp;</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">3d) and the regions east and northeast of the collision zone show minor east–west shortening (Figs.&nbsp;3d and 6c), in disagreement with observations. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Furthermore, no deformation structures are observed in East and Southeast Asia (Fig.&nbsp;4d), which is also in disagreement with observations (Fig.&nbsp;1a).<br><br></span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Four evolutionary stages of models IINT-R and IMIN-R are shown in Supplementary Figs.&nbsp;</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">5 and 6, respectively, illustrating that shortening north of the Indian indenter and extension north and west of the Sunda and Western Pacific subduction margins, respectively, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">are active from the earliest stages. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Such early extension is consistent with extension observed in East and Southeast Asia that starts already in the Early Cenozoic, such as the Sumatra, Java and East Borneo Basins, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">the margins of the South China Sea, the basins in East and Northeast China, the Baikal Rift zone and the basins in the Sea of Okhotsk region (Fig.&nbsp;</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">1a).<br><br></span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Pacific subduction drives east–west extension in Tibet.<br><br></span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Tibet is characterized by extensional structures, which are best developed in southern and central Tibet at 200–800&thinsp;km from the India–Eurasia plate boundary. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">The extensional structures consist of north to north–northeast striking normal faults, grabens and dikes active since at least ~19&thinsp;Ma, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">with some dikes with reported activity at 47–38&thinsp;Ma. The extensional structures have been ascribed to </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">various driving mechanisms that have been simulated in geodynamic models focussing on the Himalaya–Tibet region,</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">including gravitational collapse of the plateau that is triggered by convective removal of the lithospheric root, underthrusting of India and related basal shear tractions and lower crustal flow. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Our geodynamic models focus on a much larger spatial domain, about an order of magnitude larger, than these earlier models and do not incorporate convective removal of the lithospheric root, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">nor Indian underthrusting nor lower crustal flow. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Yet, our models reproduce east–west extension in the Tibetan Plateau region (Figs.&nbsp;3 and 6), indicating that the earlier proposed mechanisms are not essential for reproducing the east–west extension. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">As such, our models provide an alternative driving mechanism in which east-directed rollback of the Western Pacific subduction boundary and associated mantle flow (Fig.&nbsp;</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">7) induce east–west extension north of the Indian indenter. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Several tens of kilometres of east–west extension in southern and central Tibet are reproduced in our experiments but only for those experiments that have eastward Pacific slab rollback (IMIN-R, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">IINT-R and IMAX-R, Figs.&nbsp;</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">3 and 6d). These experiments can also account for a possible Eocene onset of east–west extension, as Pacific rollback was already active during this time. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">There is no east–west extension in southern Tibet without Pacific rollback (IINT-NR with R&thinsp;=&thinsp;1; Fig.&nbsp;</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">6d), suggesting that such rollback is indeed required for extension to take place. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Estimates of total east–west extension in Tibet range from 20 to 70&thinsp;km, comparable to our experiments with R&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.25–0.62 showing 16–54&thinsp;km of east–west extension.<br><br></span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Fig. 7.<br><br></span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Top views of experiment

subduction zones can affect the continental deep interior of Asia, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">including Tibet and the Baikal region located many thousands of kilometres (~3000–4000&thinsp;km) from the subduction margin, has implications for the extension recorded in ancient orogens. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Examples include the Paleozoic Variscan, Caledonian and Appelachian orogens, which experienced syn-orogenic, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">late-orogenic and/or post-orogenic extension that could have resulted from far field subduction forces in a manner alike that for East Asia. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Indeed, subduction zones were located far from these mountain belts at the time of extension.<br><br></span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Constraining Indian indentation.<br><br></span><span style="cursor: pointer;">The least-squares best-fit trend lines for experimental data showing central East Asian extension as a function of Indian indentation II (Fig.&nbsp;</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">6a) can be used to constrain II in nature through comparison with observed extension. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">The best-fit lines imply that II&thinsp;≤&thinsp;~2040&thinsp;km, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">because otherwise the trend lines predict too little extension (&lt;75&thinsp;km) or east–west shortening in central East Asia, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">which is in disagreement with geological observations of 75–165&thinsp;km of extension. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Additionally, II&thinsp;≥&thinsp;~1440&thinsp;km, because otherwise the trend lines predict extension in central East Asia that is larger than observed. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">The above leads us to conclude that 1740&thinsp;±&thinsp;300&thinsp;km of India–Eurasia convergence since the start of collision has been accommodated by indentation (Indian subduction hinge advance) causing Central, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">East and Southeast Asian deformation, in agreement with recent data. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Such indentation predicts ~260–360&thinsp;km of average eastward extrusion (Fig.&nbsp;</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">6b), comparable to estimates of ~250&thinsp;km based on tectonic reconstructions but significantly less than high values (800–1250&thinsp;km) proposed earlier. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Indian indentation amounts to about one-half to two-thirds of the total estimated convergence, the remainder of which has to have been accommodated by Indian continental subduction, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">for which there is evidence.<br><br></span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Discussion.<br><br></span><span style="cursor: pointer;">The first-order agreement between nature and our best fitting model IINT-R (and to a lesser </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">extent model IMIN-R) is striking and relates to the spatial distribution and orientation of thrust faults,</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">strike-slip faults and normal faults, to the morphology of the mountain ranges, to the amount of extension in East Asia, Southeast Asia and Tibet and to geodetic observations. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Regarding shortening and mountain building, the main agreements include shortening structures north of the Indian indenter with approximately east–west to NNE–SSW striking folds and thrust faults (Figs.&nbsp;</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">1a, 3a, b and 4a, b), a mountainous region north of the Indian indenter that is narrower in the west and widens eastward, similar to the Himalaya–Tibet mountains (Supplementary Fig.&nbsp;</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">4), </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">and topographic elevations of the experimental mountain ranges in the Himalaya–Tibet region with respect to the undeformed </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">foreland that scale to 5.3–9.2&thinsp;km (IINT-R) and 3.5–6.7&thinsp;km (IMIN-R) in nature (Supplementary Fig.</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">4). </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">As for strike-slip faulting, the main similarities are dextral, approximately north-south striking, strike-slip faults east of the indenter and associated conjugate sinistral faults, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">similar to the Sagin fault and conjugates east of India, and less developed sinistral, approximately north-south striking strike slip faults west of the indenter (Figs.&nbsp;</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">1a, 3a, b and 4a, b), as well as sinistral, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">NE–SW striking strike-slip faults that run from the northern edge of the mountainous region to the northeast (Sea of Okhotsk region), </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">similar to sinistral shear zones such as the Altyn Tagh fault, Bolnai fault and Stanovoy sinistral shear zone (Figs.&nbsp;</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">1a, 3b and 4b). </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">The agreement relating to normal faulting and extension includes normal faults, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">rifts and grabens in East Asia that strike predominantly sub-parallel to the strike of the </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Western Pacific subduction margin and occur up to several thousand km from the margin (Figs.</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">1a and 4a, b), normal faults, rifts and grabens near the Sunda margin that strike predominantly sub-parallel to the strike of this subduction margin (Figs.&nbsp;</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">1a and 4a, b) and a subordinate number of normal faults, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">rifts and grabens in East and Southeast Asia that strike at an oblique angle or sub-perpendicularly to the Western Pacific and Sunda subduction margins (Figs.&nbsp;</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">1a and 4a, b). </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">We note that there is also agreement in terms of extension magnitude, with major extension in northern East Asia, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">moderate extension in central East Asia and minor east–west extension in the Tibetan region (Fig.&nbsp;</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">6a–d). </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Finally, there is also agreement between the best-fitting models and nature in terms of displacements, with east- and southeast-directed displacement fields in East and Southeast Asia, respectively, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">that are reproduced in the experiments (Fig.&nbsp;</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">5a, b).<br><br></span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Some discrepancies between observations and models are also evident, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">such as the occurrence in nature of local zones of compressive tectonics along the Pacific and Sunda margins during the latest Cenozoic. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">For example, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">a local segment of the Sunda convergent margin in the southeasternmost part of Southeast Asia (Timor–Banda segment) has experienced shortening tectonics due to continental subduction of Australian continental passive margin, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">which initiated ~3.5&thinsp;Ma, while backarc spreading and extensional tectonics in the Banda Sea took place until as recently as 3&thinsp;Ma (Fig.&nbsp;</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">1a). </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Along the Pacific margin, Taiwan and northern Honshu Island in Japan have also experienced shortening, but again, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">these are relatively local phenomena compared to the scale of East and Southeast Asia and they </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">have only been active since 3–2&thinsp;Ma for Taiwan and ~3.5&thinsp;Ma for northern Honshu.</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">There are also reports of short-lived (~1–2&thinsp;Myr) inversion and compression for older times along the East and Southeast Asian margins, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">such as during the late Oligocene in the southern Sumatra basin and the Chezhen basin, a sub-basin of the Bohai basin in Northeast China. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Such local, short-lived phases of overriding plate compression and shortening can be explained, for example, by subduction of a short aseismic ridge or small oceanic plateau. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">These phases of compression, shortening and inversion are thus local and lasted only for a short duration, while the overall, large-scale, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">tectonics of East and Southeast Asia during most of the Cenozoic has been dominated by extension, as is evident from Fig.&nbsp;</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">1a.<br><br></span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Another discrepancy between our models and observations relates to large dextral strike-slip faults located near, and running sub-parallel to, or striking obliquely to, the East Asian margin, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">such as the Tan–Lu fault and the Sakhalin–Hokkaido dextral shear zone (Fig.&nbsp;</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">1a). </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">The latter, bordering the Sea of Okhotsk–Kuril basin backarc domain, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">has up to several hundred kilometres of dextral offset and has been explained by local asymmetrical slab rollback of the Kuril–Kamchatka subduction segment. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">The Tan–Lu fault, although hundreds of kilometres long, has a Cenozoic dextral offset of only ~21&thinsp;km. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Furthermore, this fault and the Bohai Bay basin immediately west of it have accommodated dextral transtension, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">of which the dextral component has been interpreted as resulting from the oblique convergence between the Pacific and Eurasian plates. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">We note, however, that model IINT-R also shows signs of dextral transtension near the Western Pacific subduction boundary along the Ryukyu–Japan–Kuril–Kamchatka segment.<br><br></span><span style="cursor: pointer;">The conclusion that the Asian tectonic evolution is best characterized by II&thinsp;=&thinsp;1740&thinsp;±&thinsp;300&thinsp;km (R&thinsp;=&thinsp;~</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">0.40–0.52) has important implications for domain boundary migrations and upper mantle volume fluxes in the eastern hemisphere.</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">With II&thinsp;=&thinsp;1740&thinsp;km, the total upper mantle volume flux induced by the advancing Indian slab is roughly 3.5&thinsp;×&thinsp;10&thinsp;km over 52&thinsp;Myr, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">while those of the retreating Western Pacific slabs and Sunda slab are roughly 2.0&thinsp;×&thinsp;10&thinsp;km and 1.7&thinsp;×&thinsp;10&thinsp;km over ~52&thinsp;Myr, respectively (Fig.&nbsp;</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">1c). </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">It implies that, since ~52&thinsp;Ma the upper mantle domain beneath East Asia has been growing at an average rate of ~100&thinsp;m&thinsp;s, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">the Indian upper mantle domain has been growing at ~1100&thinsp;m&thinsp;s, while the Pacific upper mantle domain has been shrinking at ~1200&thinsp;m&thinsp;s. We propose that, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">to accommodate the expansion in easternmost Asia, mantle material north of the Indian slab has moved eastward, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">consistent with East Asian geochemistry of Cenozoic magmatic rocks showing a Dupal signature and shear-wave splitting observations showing an overall approximately east–west trend below East China (Fig.&nbsp;</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">1b, c) and in agreement with the general mantle flow pattern observed in our models (Fig.&nbsp;7). </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Locally, Pacific mantle material has likely infiltrated the Asian domain through slab windows below northernmost Kamchatka and the Taiwan–Philippines region (Fig.&nbsp;1b, c). </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">The hole left by Indian indentation and slab advance has been partly filled by Burma–Sunda slab-rollback-</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">induced mantle flow and by toroidal mantle return flow around the eastern and western Himalayan syntaxes,</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">as suggested by shear-wave splitting observations.<br><br></span><span style="cursor: pointer;">We note that shear-wave splitting observations imply a tighter toroidal flow around the eastern syntaxis than observed in the models. This could be because of two reasons. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">First of all, it is likely that there is a small slab window just south of the eastern syntaxis, because the Arakan slab only continues to ~26.5° north, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">while the northern edge of the eastern syntaxis is at ~28° north. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">In addition, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">there is likely a slab window between the Arakan slab and the Andaman slab (between ~</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">15° and ~20° north) and the Arakan slab is likely also segmented and torn.</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Such slab windows/gaps/tears would allow mantle material to flow from the Tibetan side (higher dynamic pressure), </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">around the eastern syntaxis and towards the Indian side south of the Himalayan slab (lower dynamic pressure), as illustrated by the orange arrow in Fig.&nbsp;</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">1b. The orientation of flow is consistent with shear-wave splitting results. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">In the analogue models, there is no slab window present in the Indian indenter near the eastern syntaxis, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">so inflow into the region south of the Indian indenter front is not possible and so toroidal return flow is more limited. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">A second reason could be that the analogue models use a linear viscous (Newtonian) rheology for the sub-lithospheric mantle, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">while the sub-lithospheric mantle in nature is possibly dominated by a non-linear power law rheology. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Such a power law rheology enhances strain localization thereby promoting tighter, more localized, toroidal return flow patterns around lateral slab edges.<br><br></span><span style="cursor: pointer;">To return to the topic of mantle flow in the Indian domain, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">we propose that inflow into the Indian domain is also partly accommodated by southwest to west-directed Pacific mantle flow from </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">the Philippine Sea domain towards New Guinea and northern Australia south of and sub-parallel to the Java–Banda slab wall (Fig.</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">1b, c). This is consistent with shear-wave splitting observations. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Our models thus imply large-scale exchange and mixing of mantle material between the Indian, Asian and Pacific domains along a clockwise circulation pattern, leaving an imprint on the structure, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">dynamics and chemistry of crust and mantle.<br><br></span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Methods.<br><br>Experimental set-up.<br><br></span><span style="cursor: pointer;">We use four-dimensional analogue laboratory experiments of Asian deformation, as they allow us for the first time to integrate several geodynamic processes including continental indentation, subduction rollback, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">mantle flow and continental gravitational spreading on a very large spatial scale. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">The experiments provide us a means to quantify and reproduce the surface strain field, displacement field, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">mantle flow patterns and topography at an unprecedented large scale (representing thousands of kilometres) and at the </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">same time allow us to simulate small-scale (representing kilometre scale) strain localization through faulting and shearing.</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">The experiments consist of a layered rheological system, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">with a brittle top layer and underlying high-viscosity layer representing the continental lithosphere and a low-viscosity bottom layer representing the sub-lithospheric mantle, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">following earlier experimental work on continental lithospheric deformation and backarc extension. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">The lithosphere is confined within an internal rectangular compartment, 100&thinsp;cm&thinsp;×&thinsp;110&thinsp;cm horizontally, that is located within a larger rectangular box, 130&thinsp;×&thinsp;150&thinsp;cm, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">that is filled with the sub-lithospheric mantle (Fig.&nbsp;</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">2). </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">At sub-lithospheric mantle depth, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">the internal compartment (representing the Eurasian domain) and the outer domain (representing the oceanic domains) are connected through a window in the southeastern corner (representing a slab window zone </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">in Southeast Asia) such that the continental lithosphere inside the internal compartment is isostatically supported by the sub-lithospheric mantle and is in isostatic equilibrium with the oceanic domains.</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Continental deformation in the Central, East and Southeast Asian lithosphere is enforced through three externally driven boundaries to simulate approximately northward Indian indentation, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">approximately southward rotational rollback of the Sunda subduction zone and approximately eastward translational–rotational rollback of the Western Pacific subduction zones (Fig.&nbsp;</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">2). Considering that we impose velocities, our models are not fully dynamic (exclusively buoyancy-driven) but include both kinematically imposed forces and internal buoyancy forces. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">The velocities of the three boundaries can be set individually by three individual step-motors. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">The northern (leading) boundary of the Indian intender block represents the Indian subduction hinge and slab, and so the advance velocity of this block, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">which is determined by step-motor 1, is exactly the advance velocity of the subduction hinge and slab. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">The retreating boundaries that are connected to step-motors 2 and 3 represent the retreating slabs and subduction hinges of the Sunda and Western Pacific subduction margins, respectively, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">and their velocities represent the retreat velocities of the subduction hinges and slabs. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">The boundary velocity values for the different experiments discussed in the text are listed in Table&nbsp;1.<br><br></span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Table 1 Experimental and scaled displacements and displacement rates of the three plate boundaries.<br>Full size table.<br><br></span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Our models do not include subduction zone plate boundary-induced simple shear, as is also the case for earlier models of India–Asia indentation and Asian deformation. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">We note that the simple shear at the continental and oceanic subduction boundaries impose a local deformation on the overriding plate, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">as the length-scale of the deformation induced by the simple shear scales with the down-dip length of the subduction zone interface (e.g. see ref. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">), which is of the order 100–200&thinsp;km. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">As such, the simple shear at the subduction boundaries is not significant for the large-scale (thousands of km), widespread deformation of Central, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">East and Southeast Asia that is the focus of this study.<br><br></span><span style="cursor: pointer;">For the current study, we have chosen analogue experiments as our geodynamic modelling method, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">as they have a number of advantages for the purpose of this study compared to other geodynamic modelling methods, namely: </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">(1) The analogue models are inherently four-dimensional (three-dimensional space+time). </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">(2) The analogue models can be conducted at a massive scale (e.g. continental lithosphere of 8000&thinsp;km&thinsp;×&thinsp;8800&thinsp;km), </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">while still retaining enough resolution at small scale to simulate shear localization and brittle faulting in the upper part of the continental lithosphere. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">(3) The models have a free top surface such that they can produce mountain topography and morphology that are comparable to that in the Tibet–Himalaya region, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">as well as basin bathymetry and morphology that are comparable to the marginal basins in East and Southeast Asia.<br><br></span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Scaling of experiments and experimental materials.<br><br></span><span style="cursor: pointer;">The experiments are scaled for gravity such that they fulfil the requirements of geometrical, kinematic and dynamic similarity with respect to the natural prototype. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">The scaling parameters are listed in Table&nbsp;2. Previous models simulating Asian deformation that were scaled for </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">gravity and were isostatically supported by an asthenosphere used smaller scaled lengths than the current study.</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">In the current experiments, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">a length-scale factor of 1.25&thinsp;×&thinsp;10 is applied (1&thinsp;cm represents 80&thinsp;km) such that </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">the Indian indenter width (east–west) of 30&thinsp;cm represents 2400&thinsp;km in nature (approximate width of Indian indenter),</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">a 50&thinsp;cm retreating Sunda subduction boundary represents 4000&thinsp;km, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">a 100&thinsp;cm Western Pacific retreating subduction boundary represents 8000&thinsp;km and a continental lithosphere thickness of 1.3&thinsp;cm represents 104&thinsp;km. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">These scaled model dimensions are of comparable magnitude as those in nature at the onset of collision at ~50&thinsp;Ma (Fig.&nbsp;1c). </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">The sub-lithospheric mantle layer is 7.7&thinsp;cm thick, representing 616&thinsp;km in nature. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Each experiment lasts 40&thinsp;h, which represents ~52 million years in nature, giving a model/nature timescale factor of 8.781&thinsp;×&thinsp;10. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">We note that, in our models, the thickness of the Asian continental lithosphere and the thickness of its individual layers are constant at the start of each model run. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">It is therefore evident that we did not consider any potential lateral variations in lithospheric thickness caused by earlier phases of deformation of the Asian lithosphere.<br><br></span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Table 2 Experimental scaling parameters.<br>Full size table.<br><br></span><span style="cursor: pointer;">In the experiments, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">we scale for density contrasts and we adopt a constant density for the continental lithosphere of 1232&thinsp;±&thinsp;7&thinsp;</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">kg&thinsp;m and a constant density for the sub-lithospheric mantle of ρSLM&thinsp;=&thinsp;1426&thinsp;±&thinsp;2&thinsp;kg&thinsp;m,</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">giving a density contrast Δρ(model)&thinsp;=&thinsp;194&thinsp;±&thinsp;9&thinsp;kg&thinsp;m.

dynamic shear viscosity of 5.8&thinsp;±&thinsp;0.2&thinsp;×&thinsp;10&thinsp;Pa&thinsp;s.<br><br></span><span style="cursor: pointer;">The bottom layer representing the sub-lithospheric mantle consists of glucose syrup, which is a Newtonian viscous material, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">with a dynamic shear viscosity of 254&thinsp;±&thinsp;7&thinsp;Pa&thinsp;s at 20&thinsp;±&thinsp;0.5&thinsp;°C, which is the temperature at which the experiments are conducted. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">With a viscosity scaling factor of 1.1&thinsp;×&thinsp;10, the experimental sub-lithospheric upper mantle viscosity represents 2.3&thinsp;×&thinsp;10&thinsp;Pa&thinsp;s in nature, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">which is in general accordance with values estimated previously, which are of the order 10–10&thinsp;Pa&thinsp;s.<br><br></span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Dynamic scaling requires that the experiments are conducted in the same flow regime as in nature (laminar flow regime with dihedral symmetry across two orthogonal planes), </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">which demands that the Reynolds number Re&thinsp;&lt;&lt;&thinsp;1, with Re&thinsp;=&thinsp;ρvd/η. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Here ρ is the density of the ambient fluid (1426&thinsp;kg&thinsp;m for the sub-lithospheric mantle), </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">v is the characteristic velocity (we take the velocity of the Indian indenter for experiment IINT-R, vI&thinsp;=&thinsp;1.6&thinsp;×&thinsp;10&thinsp;m&thinsp;s), </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">d is the characteristic length scale (we take the width of the Indian indenter, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">d&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.30 m) and η is the dynamic shear viscosity of the ambient fluid (254&thinsp;Pa&thinsp;s for the sub-lithospheric mantle). </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">This gives an experimental Re&thinsp;=&thinsp;2.7&thinsp;×&thinsp;10&thinsp;&lt;&lt;&thinsp;1.<br><br></span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Considering that the experiments are scaled for gravity, that the Asian continental lithosphere is isostatically supported and that there are lateral density differences between the continental and oceanic domains, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">there are elevation differences and gravitational potential energy differences in the experiments. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">The average density of the continental Asian lithosphere is lower than that of the oceanic domains, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">and therefore its elevation and potential energy are higher than that of the surrounding oceanic domains. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">With a length scaling factor of 1.25&thinsp;×&thinsp;10 in our models and a CTopo&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.44, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">we calculate that the elevation of the undeformed continental lithosphere with respect to the oceanic domains scales to 6.2&thinsp;km. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">This is effectively the same as the elevation difference in nature (~6&thinsp;km) with an average ocean basin depth in the Western </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Pacific and Northeast Indian Ocean of ~5–6&thinsp;km below sea level and an average continental elevation of ~0–1&thinsp;km above sea level.</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Recording of experiments.<br><br></span><span style="cursor: pointer;">The experiments have been recorded with a particle image velocimetry (PIV) system using four digital cameras. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Camera one provided a top view overview of the entire experiment in order to record the progressive evolution </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">of the surface structures and to extract the evolution of the surface strain field and displacement field.</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Cameras two and three were set up in stereoscopic arrangement (sPIV) in order to extract the progressive evolution of the surface topography of part of the experimental surface area. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Camera four provided an oblique view to record the progressive evolution of the surface structures. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Details on PIV and sPIV recordings for flow, surface strain and surface topography can be found in earlier works.<br><br></span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Rates of advance and retreat.<br><br></span><span style="cursor: pointer;">We test the role of the advance rate (indentation rate) of the India–Eurasia collisional boundary, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">i.e. the rate of migration of the Indian continental subduction zone hinge and slab towards the overriding Eurasian plate, on the style and extent of widespread continental deformation in Central, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">East and Southeast Asia. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">This advance rate is varied with respect to the rollback (retreat) rates of the Western Pacific and Sunda subduction zones, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">which are kept constant except for experiment IINT-NR where the rollback rates are zero. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">We keep these Western Pacific and Sunda rollback rates constant because they are better constrained from reconstructions, total extension estimates and seismic tomography than the Indian hinge advance rate, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">which is less constrained due to uncertainty in the total amount of Asian shortening. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">With this analogue modelling approach, we can, for the first time, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">provide insight into the possible dynamic interaction between the Pacific and Sunda subduction zones and the collision zone and how this has shaped the Asian landscape and interior. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">The advance rate can be derived from the amount of shortening that has been accommodated in the overriding plate since the start of collision between India and Eurasia, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">which we assume to have occurred at 52&thinsp;Ma and is within the range of 52–55&thinsp;Ma proposed recently. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Total shortening estimates range from a minimum of ~1000&thinsp;km to a maximum of 1800–2000&thinsp;km. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">These estimates provide geologically constrained lower and upper bounds for the advance rate of 2.0 and 3.6&thinsp;cm&thinsp;year, respectively. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">We also test Asian deformation with an absolute maximum advance rate of 5.2&thinsp;cm&thinsp;year assuming that the India–Eurasia </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">convergence rate (some 5–6&thinsp;cm&thinsp;year averaged over the past 52&thinsp;Myr) is accommodated entirely by indentation of Eurasia.</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Finally, we have run several other experiments (not shown), one of which tested Asian deformation without India–Asia indentation (Indian advance rate&thinsp;=&thinsp;0&thinsp;cm&thinsp;year). </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">This experiment is dominated by rift and graben structures, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">most of them striking (sub)parallel to the Pacific subduction boundary in the east and northeast and sub-parallel to the Sunda subduction boundary in the south, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">as well as a significant number of extensional structures that have an oblique or perpendicular strike with respect to the subduction boundaries.<br><br></span><span

This range is based on estimates of relatively minor extension of 5&thinsp;km (±5&thinsp;km) for each of the following rifts/basins: Hetao–Yinchuan rift, Shanxi rift, </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Southwest Bohai basin, and the region between the Southwest Bohai Basin and East China Sea (giving a sub-total of 20&thinsp;km&thinsp;±&thinsp;20&thinsp;km); </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">40&thinsp;km (±10&thinsp;km) for the East China Sea margin; and 60&thinsp;km (±15&thinsp;km) for the Okinawa Trough. </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">These last two estimates are based on the present-day average crustal thickness in the East China Sea margin (27&thinsp;km) and Okinawa Trough (18&thinsp;km) and </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">the average crustal thickness of the undeformed margins (30&thinsp;km) as derived from a regional crustal thickness map and the extension implied by this crustal thickness difference.</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">This gives a total extension of 120&thinsp;km (±45&thinsp;km).<br><br></span><span style="cursor: pointer;">The approximate range of values for the total amount of east–west extension in Tibet due to </span><span style="cursor: pointer;">Cenozoic normal faulting along approximately north–south to NNE–SSW trending grabens and rifts is presented in Fig.</span><span style="cursor: pointer;">6d.
